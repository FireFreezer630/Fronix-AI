# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

This project aims to create an AI Chat Assistant similar to ChatGPT, integrating with the OpenAI API and potentially other AI providers like Azure. The application should feature a user-friendly interface with conversation management, API settings configuration, and chat functionality.

The primary goals are:

- Implement a functional chat interface.
- Allow users to configure API settings for different AI providers.
- Enable conversation management (new chat, switch chat, delete chat).
- Support Markdown in messages.
- Implement a responsive UI design.
- Store conversations and settings locally.
