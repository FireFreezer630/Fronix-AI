# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The "toolResponses is not iterable" error has been resolved.

## Recent Changes

- Created initial memory bank files.
- Renamed `src/services/api.js` to `src/services/api.jsx` to fix JSX parsing error.
- Updated import statement in `src/App.jsx` to reflect the file rename.

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with different models and configurations to ensure the fix is effective for the Pollinations AI model selection issue. The model should be correctly used when making API calls to Pollinations.ai.
2. Continue implementing web search capabilities.
3. Continue implementing image generation.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The Pollinations AI API is now the default.
- The Pollinations AI API will be set as the default.
- How to handle potential errors when fetching data from the Pollinations AI API. The `tools` parameter is now always included in the request body when using the `/openai` endpoint.
