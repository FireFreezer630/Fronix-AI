# Progress

## What Works

- Basic chat interface is functional.
- API settings can be configured.
- Conversations can be managed.
- "toolResponses is not iterable" error has been resolved by renaming `src/services/api.js` to `src/services/api.jsx` and updating the import statement in `src/App.jsx`.
- The Pollinations AI API is now the default.
- Pollinations AI model selection issue has been resolved by updating the `useEffect` hook and the initial state in `src/components/SettingsModal.jsx` and by updating the `fetchChatCompletion` function in `src/services/api.jsx` to correctly use the selected model. The `tools` parameter is now always included in the request body when using the `/openai` endpoint.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement web search capabilities.
- Implement image generation.
